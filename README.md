# Convex-Hull-Algorithms-Python
In this project, different algorithms were developed to construct a convex hull in 2D using a given number of points. 
At the end of the execution, the Convex Hull edges and the elapsed time are printed. 

## How to Run: 
    python3 main.py <select number of points> <select algorithm>
### Algorithms to choose:
  - Incremental
  - Gift
  - Divide
  - Quickhull
  - visual (visual representation of Quickhull)
### Prerequisites:
 - Matplotlib 3.8.0 and above
